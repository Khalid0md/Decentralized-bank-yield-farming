# Advanced Sample Hardhat Project - Decentralized Bank with yield farming and rewards functionality

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with 4 solidity contracts, a test, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

This project is still in development and will soon incorporate a front end UI before becoming a finished project
